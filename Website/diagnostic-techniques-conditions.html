                <h2>Permitted Purposes</h2>
                <p>The use of pre-natal diagnostic techniques is permitted strictly for the purpose of detecting specific genetic abnormalities, as defined under the Act or subsequently notified by the Government.</p>

                <h2>Qualifying Conditions</h2>
                <p>Pre-natal diagnostic techniques may only be conducted when at least one of the following conditions related to the pregnant woman is fulfilled:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Age Factor:</strong> She is above 35 years of age</li>
                    <li><strong>Previous Pregnancy Loss:</strong> She has experienced two or more instances of spontaneous abortion or foetal loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Exposure to Harmful Agents:</strong> She has been exposed to potentially teratogenic agents such as drugs, radiation, infection, or hazardous chemicals</li>
                    <li><strong>Family History:</strong> There is a documented family history of mental retardation, physical deformities, or other heritable genetic diseases</li>
                    <li><strong>Other Conditions:</strong> Any other specific condition as stipulated within the Act</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Documentation Requirements</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> The medical reason for conducting such diagnostic procedures must be formally documented in writing at the time they are performed.
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Medical Supervision</h2>
                <p>All procedures must be conducted under proper medical supervision by qualified practitioners at registered facilities. The Act ensures that these techniques are used only for legitimate medical purposes and not for sex determination.</p>
